> A safe implementation of the secure remote password authentication and key-exchange protocol (SRP version 6a).

## About SRP6

> The Secure Remote Password protocol performs secure remote authentication of short human-memorizable passwords and resists both passive and active network attacks. Because SRP offers this unique combination of password security, user convenience, and freedom from restrictive licenses, it is the most widely standardized protocol of its type, and as a result is being used by organizations both large and small, commercial and open-source, to secure nearly every type of human-authenticated network traffic on a variety of computing platforms.

read more at [srp.stanford.edu](http://srp.stanford.edu) and in [RFC2945] that describes in detail the Secure remote password protocol.

## Features

- client and server implementation of SRP 6 / 6a as in [RFC2945]
- key length of 1024 to 8192 bit provided as in [RFC5054]
- sha512 hashing instead of sha1
- free of unsafe code
- no openssl dependencies
- rust native

## Feature flags

- `default` - uses `hash-sha512` and keys >= 2048 bit
- `dangerous` - uses `hash-sha1` and provides keys < 2048 bit, please do not use this in production code.
- `wow` - uses `hash-sha1`, insecure keys and a uppercase of username and password for the hash, please do not use this in production code. This is used in an old World of Warcraft client.

Those flags are only used for specific test scenarios and should not be used in production code.
